**Is your suggestion a utility or component?**
If you are unsure, view the readme for further information.  

**Expected functionality of your suggestion (IN-DEPTH)**
I.e:
- varied utility classes for `font-size` in relation to the PX.  `.fz-16` = `font-size: 16px;`.
- A preloader component which hides all content until the page is adequately loaded. The component should support BS accent classes (*-.danger`, for example).

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. please attempt to include expected visual structure & output of components through the use of illustrations or similar.
