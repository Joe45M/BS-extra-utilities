Please label your suggestion accordingly- `suggestion` & `utility` OR `component`.  

### What is a utility Class? 
As defined by by Bootstrap, a utility is (generally) a class which provides, or enables added functionality or cosmetic enhancements. Bootstrap utilities tend to come as a bundle with multiple variations, such as `.pt-1`, where the CSS attached to `.pt-1` contains the property `padding-top: ($spacer * .25);`. A full list of current utilities can be found in the most recent version of the Boostrap documentation, [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/utilities/borders/).

### What is a component?
A component is a snippet of HTML which provides a structured "element", such as a `nav`, `alert` and similiar. A full list of current components can be found [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/).

## BS version
